getFLVAVCRes is mostly composed of avc.c, avc.h and types.h from FLVMeta
version 1.0.9, which is available at http://code.google.com/p/flvmeta/

avc.c has been modified with a main() to read the resolution of the given
FLV AVC file, and types.h has had a #include commented out that was not
required for building getFLVAVCRes.
